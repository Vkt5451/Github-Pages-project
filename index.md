## Where and When Did my Journey Begin?
> Hello World

I would have never known that my journey to becoming a programmer and software engineer would have began with such a simple quote from above! I began to code in the summer of 2022 at my community college in Sacramento. At **Folsom Lake College**, I began having aspirations in learning computer science! Now, I am a 3rd year Computer student at UC San Diego and I am excited for the rest of the journey! I enjoy working out, hiking, and nature walks! Lastly, my name is Vincent Trinh!

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world and Folsom Lake College!")
```
